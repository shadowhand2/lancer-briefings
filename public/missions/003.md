# Mission // #003
## I'm In Your Mind Fuzz
# Goals
- Reach Klanni undetected before the start of the Restoration Festival
- Access the storage facility where the AI unit is being kept
  - Retrieve the unit
- Escape the festival, and rendezvous at the provided escape vessel

# Stakes
- Time is critical. The Restoration Festival provides a limited opportunity when the city's security will have more pressing concerns, and if we miss this chance then there is a whole year where the target could be moved anywhere.
 
# Reserves
- None at this time.
