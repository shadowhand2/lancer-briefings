# MSMC Transport Carrier // 2.21.5014u
The squad finally met each other en-route to the recently-rediscovered planetoid known as **Hercynia**. Guided by MSMC Commanding Officer SNAKEMAN, Squad DELTA-ECHO-ECHO-ZULU was given a rudimentary team-building exercise known as **VIRTUAL TRAINING**. 

**KAL** attempted to tap into the main systems in order to give her team an advantage - this backfired spectacularly, as SNAKEMAN was staring at her with his one good eye as she failed to guess the passphrase he had chosen as the administrator login - ~~GARM~~. Because of this, the squad was pushed to the brink in what was supposed to be a confidence booster.
