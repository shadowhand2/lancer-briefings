# The Nullor District // DS-8 // 03.06.5016u
Having met with **Lieutenant Kizhe** in the day previous, the squad went to meet with **Mayor Buccheri** to discuss the resources required to reach **Thoe** and get into the city. After Nayuta received a call from **Girigi Lyueva** the party decided to instead send a representative from the **House of No Fixed Abode**, and went of to **The Nullor Disctrict** to give Girigi a hand.

The squad discovered that a prototype mech that one of **Girigi's** associates had sent him to have a look at had gone haywire, stealing the control unit for **Girigi's** subalterns and escaping into **The Nullor District**. After racing in to track down the haywire mech, and retrieve **Girigi's** subaltern units, they managed to smash the place up enough to warrant a police response.

# Kyaside // DS-2 // 24.05.5016u
The party heads out to **DS-2** to hunt down a prototype mech that was stolen from **HA** by an independent research group on the planet. After landing in **Kyaside**, they managed to sneak their way aboard a delivery vessel that had been delivering mech shipments to the research facility. **Dirk** and **Nayuta** subdued two workers and gained access to the more secure sections of the research facility, and the rest of the squad followed suit in their frames. They managed to reach the section of the facility where the prototype was stored without triggering any serious security alarms, and quickly set to work subduing the mech. After a brief skirmish, **Nessa** managed to wrest control of the prototype from its inexperienced pilot, and quickly turned the tides of battle in the party's favour. With assistance of one terrified and recently nearly killed researcher, they were able to access the remaining data that had been gathered on the prototype, and escape the planet before any serious law enforcement arrived.
